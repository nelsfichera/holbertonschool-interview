# 0. Radix sort
## Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix sort algorithm
- Prototype: void radix_sort(int *array, size_t size);
- You must implement the LSD radix sort algorithm
- You can assume that array will contain only numbers >= 0
- You are allowed to use malloc and free for this task
- Youâ€™re expected to print the array each time you increase your significant digit (See example below)
