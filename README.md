# Holberton School Interview Algorithms
## 0x00. Lockboxes
### You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes. Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

## 0x01. Insert in sorted linked list
### Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

## 0x02. Heap Insert 
### Write a function that creates a binary tree node.

## 0x03. Minimum Operations
### In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

## 0x04. Sandpiles
### Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles.

## 0x05. Linked list palindrome
### Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

## 0x06. Log Parsing
### Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics.

## 0x07. Linked list cycle
### Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

## 0x08. Palindrome integer 
### Write a function that checks whether or not a given unsigned integer is a palindrome.

## 0x09. UTF-8 Validation 
### Write a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## 0x0A. 2048 (single line) 
### The goal of this task is to reproduce the 2048 game(NSFW !!) mechanics on a single horizontal line.

### Given an array of integers, we want to be able to slide & merge it to the left or to the right. Identical numbers, if they are contiguous or separated by zeros, should be merged (See example)

## 0x0B. Menger sponge 
### Write a function that draws a 2D Menger Sponge.

## 0x0C. N Queens 
### The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

## 0x0D. Array to AVL
### Write a function that builds an AVL tree from an array.

## 0x0E. Linear search in skip list 
### Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted skip list of integers.

## 0x0F. Star Wars API 
### Write a script that prints all characters of a Star Wars movie.

## 0x10. Rain 
### Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1, as if viewing the cross-section of a relief map, calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.

## 0x11. Heap Sort
### Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm.

## 0x12. Advanced Binary Search
### Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers.

## 0x13. Count it!
### Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (case-insensitive, delimited by spaces. Javascript should count as javascript, but java should not).

## 0x14. Heap Extract
### Write a function that extracts the root node of a Max Binary Heap.

## 0x15. Infinite Multiplication 
### Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers. 

## 0x16. Rotate 2D Matrix
### Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

## 0x17. Find the Loop 
### Write a function that finds the loop in a linked list.

## 0x18. Merge Sort 
### Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm.

## 0x19. Making Change 
### Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

## 0x1A. Double Circular Linked List
### Create the source file 0-add_node.c that contains the following functions. 

## 0x1B. Radix Sort
### Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix sort algorithm

## 0x1C. Island Perimeter
### Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid.

## 0x1D. AVL Trees 
### Write a function that checks if a binary tree is a valid AVL Tree

## 0x1E. Wild Compare
### Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.

## 0x1F. Pascal's Triangle
### Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n

## 0x20. RegEx
### Write a function that checks whether a given pattern matches a given string.

## 0x21. Substring with concatenated words
### Write a function that finds all the possible substrings containing a list of words, within a given string.

## 0x22. Prime Game
### Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including n, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game.

### They play x rounds of the game, where n may be different for each round. Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally, determine who the winner of each game is.
